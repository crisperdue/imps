<h2> <a name="intro"> Introduction </a> </h2>

<I> IMPS </I> is an Interactive Mathematical Proof System intended to
provide organizational and computational support for the traditional
techniques of mathematical reasoning.  In particular, the logic of <I>
IMPS </I> allows functions to be partial and terms to be undefined.
The system consists of a database of mathematics (represented as a
network of axiomatic theories linked by theory interpretations) and a
collection of tools for exploring, applying, extending, and
communicating the mathematics in the database.  To get a feel for the
kinds of mathematics that it is possible to do in <i> IMPS </i>, see
the description of the <a
href="ftp://math.harvard.edu/imps/imps_html/theory-library.html">main
theory library. </a> One of the chief tools of <i> IMPS </i> is a
facility for developing formal proofs.  In contrast to the formal
proofs described in logic textbooks, <I> IMPS </I> proofs are a blend
of computation and high-level inference.  Consequently, they resemble
intelligible informal proofs, but unlike informal proofs, all details
of an <I> IMPS </I> proof are machine checked.  <p>

The current version, <I> IMPS 2.0, </I> was created by Javier Thayer
F&aacute;brega by producing a macro-emulation of the T programming
language in Common Lisp which runs a suitably translated version of
the original <I> IMPS </I> source code written in T. The <I> IMPS </I>
user interface is written in the GNU Emacs programming language,
developed by R. Stallman.  <p>

<h2> <a name="starting"> Getting Started </a> </h2>

<i> IMPS </i> is a complicated system, with a hefty learning curve. We
will give you a few hints on how to get started with one of the
facilities that <i> IMPS </i> provides, namely a tool for developing
machine-checked proofs.

Begin by checking that <I> IMPS </I> loaded up
without a hitch.  To do this, go to the TEA interaction window by
clicking on the cup icon in the
toolbar. To return to this window click on the home icon.
In the TEA interaction window you
should see something like the following banner:
<pre>TIJUCA Common Lisp v. 786 
Copyright Beija Flor Software Inc.

> IMPS Version 2.0
Current Theory THE-KERNEL-THEORY
LISP:T
> 
</pre>
The display depends on the Common Lisp implementation you are using. 

There is not much you can do in the KERNEL THEORY (propositional logic
and a little more). Thus you will need to begin by changing the <I> Current Theory </I> 
to something more interesting.  To do this,
select <i> h-o-real-arithmetic </i> as the current theory (click on the
radio dial icon).

Now you can play around
with some of the proofs in the file <i> <a href =
"../theories/reals/reals-supplements.t"> reals-supplements </a> </i>.
This file contains entries such as 
<pre>(def-theorem bernoullis-inequality
  "forall(h:rr,n:zz,-1&lt;h and 1&lt;=n implies 1+n*h&lt;=(1+h)^n)"
  (theory h-o-real-arithmetic)
  (proof 


   (
    (induction integer-inductor ("n"))
    (cut-with-single-formula "0&lt;=t*h^2 and (1+h)*(1+h*t)&lt;=(1+h)*(1+h)^t")
    simplify
    simplify

    )))
</pre>
To start a proof, click on the "pencil and paper"
icon. <I> IMPS </I> will prompt you for a formula which you can enter
by selecting it with the right mouse button on the goal formula, in this case
<pre>"forall(h:rr,n:zz,-1<h and 1<=n implies 1+n*h<=(1+h)^n)"</pre>
or by entering it manually.
