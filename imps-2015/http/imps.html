<h2> <a name="intro"> Introduction </a> </h2>

<I> IMPS </I> is an Interactive Mathematical Proof System intended to
provide organizational and computational support for the traditional
techniques of mathematical reasoning.  In particular, the logic of <I>
IMPS </I> allows functions to be partial and terms to be undefined.
The system consists of a database of mathematics (represented as a
network of axiomatic theories linked by theory interpretations) and a
collection of tools for exploring, applying, extending, and
communicating the mathematics in the database.  To get a feel for the
kinds of mathematics that it is possible to do in <i> IMPS </i>, see
the description of the <a href="http://www.tiac.net/users/thayer/theory-library.html">main
theory library. </a> One of the chief tools of <i> IMPS </i> is a
facility for developing formal proofs.  In contrast to the formal
proofs described in logic textbooks, <I> IMPS </I> proofs are a blend
of computation and high-level inference.  Consequently, they resemble
intelligible informal proofs, but unlike informal proofs, all details
of an <I> IMPS </I> proof are machine checked.  <p>

<h2> <a name="getting">How to Get <I> IMPS </I> </a> </h2>

The <I> IMPS </I> system is available via ftp under the terms of a <a
href = "ftp://math.harvard.edu/imps/public-license"> public license. </a> 
 
<I> IMPS 2.0, </I> which is written in Common Lisp, runs on Linux and Solaris
platforms with at least 24 MB of physical memory, though 32 of MB
physical memory is recommended. IMPS 2.0 should work with most
versions of Common Lisp; we support Allegro CL, CLISP, CMU Common
Lisp, and GCL.  We prefer CLISP, because it produces the smallest
executables and seems well supported.  CLISP (clisp-1997-12-06) for <a
href = "http://SAL.KachinaTech.COM/A/0/IMPS.html"> Linux </a> can be
downloaded from <a href ="http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/devel/lang/lisp/">
sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/devel/lang/lisp/</a>. IMPS 2.0 runs under the
X Window System and has an Emacs-based interface; we support primarily
XEmacs versions 19 and 20.

<h2> <a name="acknowledge">Acknowledgments </a> </h2>

<I> IMPS </I> was designed and developed at The MITRE Corporation under the
MITRE-Sponsored Research program.  Ronald D. Haggarty, Senior Vice President
of Research and Technology, deserves special thanks for his strong,
unwavering support of the <I> IMPS </I> project.

<p>

Several of the key ideas behind <I> IMPS </I> were originally developed by
Dr. Leonard Monk on the Heuristics Research Project, also funded by
MITRE-Sponsored Research, during 1984-1987. 

<p>

We would like to thank the Harvard Mathematics Department and
professor David Mumford (now at Brown) in particular, for providing an
ftp site for <I> IMPS </I>. We would also like to thank the
Mathematics Department's computer system administrator, Leonid Fridman
for his valuable cooperation.

<p>

The <I> IMPS </I> core and support machinery were originally written
in the T programming language, developed at Yale by N. Adams, R.
Kelsey, D. Kranz, J.  Philbin, and J. Rees.  IMPS 2.0 was created by
F. J. Thayer by producing a macro/emulation of the T programming language
in Common Lisp.  The <I> IMPS </I> user interface is written in the
GNU Emacs programming language, developed by R. Stallman.  <p>
